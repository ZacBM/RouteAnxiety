<h1>Route Anxiety</h1>
This is a horror themed game where you have to keep your anxiety between the most extreme and the most relaxed so that you have enough energy to be awake on the road.

If you fall asleep or you get too anxious, you lose.

If you make a certain number of decisions without falling asleep or being anxious, you win.

There are 3 decisions: changing lanes, speeding up or down, and changing the music track (13 music tracks).
